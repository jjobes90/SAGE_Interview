Description of app:

The component (the whole App) is a bathtub div that fills with water when you press the increaseWaterLevel button. Starting with water level 0, once you press the button, every 2 seconds, a new blue-colored div is added inside the bathtub div (but is only 20 pixels high). After the level reaches the height of the div (100 pixels; or 5 levels), the water stops filling.

When you press the decreaseWaterLevel button, every 2 seconds, the water decreases by a div of the same height. The water counter shows the height of the water in the div.
